Refactory. Split the code into two parts, system and board. Currently, the memory related code has some const generic structs, to change to a trail, the structs have to be changed to slide of refernce. So this part will be rewroten later.
 - Add libray sys
 - Test on qemu and PRI4b

Add MMU related code
 - MMU enabled
 - Test on qemu and RPI4b

Add exception level
 - Add exception level related code
 - Change to EL1
 - Test on qemu, passed
 - Test on RPI4b, failed on RPI4b. 'sctlr_el2::M' is not 0. Is the memory mapping enable by default? The boot code enable EL2 MMU by default. Re-test it after add mmu code.
